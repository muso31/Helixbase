* A module just for fun - currently adds logos to the Unicorn console

## Setup Instructions
*Please Install Visual Studio 2017 Version 15.7 or higher as this project uses PackageReference

1. Install [Sitecore Experience Platform 9.1 Initial Release](https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Platform/91/Sitecore_Experience_Platform_91_Initial_Release.aspx)
	1. _Name your instance 'demo.helixbase'_
2. Clone project to 'C:\Projects\Helixbase'
	1. _If you use another path, update the [z.Common.DevSettings.config](https://github.com/muso31/Helixbase/blob/master/src/Project/Common/code/App_Config/Include/Project/z.Common.DevSettings.config#L3)_
3. Update the 'publishUrl' property in [Local.pubxml](https://github.com/muso31/Helixbase/blob/master/src/Website/code/Properties/PublishProfiles/Local.pubxml#L12) to the target IIS folder
4. Build the project from inside Visual Studio (which triggers HPP auto publish), or use the 'Local' publish profile in the Helixbase.Website project
5. Run Unicorn and sync all configurations

#### Using Helix Base:
Refer to the [Hero Feature](https://github.com/muso31/Helixbase/tree/master/src/Feature/Hero/code) as an example.

* View [HeroService.cs](https://github.com/muso31/Helixbase/blob/master/src/Feature/Hero/code/Services/HeroService.cs) for examples of retrieving Sitecore items using the content API and the search API.
* View [Register routes](https://github.com/muso31/Helixbase/blob/master/src/Feature/Hero/code/Routes/RegisterRoutes.cs) for an example of how to register a route.

To add a 301 redirect simply add a redirect item to the _Redirect Items_ folder found in your site _Global_ folder.

To change the item version limit edit the rule on the _/sitecore/system/Settings/Rules/Item Saved/Rules/Delete Old Versions_ item. You can also change the rule to recycle or archive old versions. 

In the security editor you can assign non admin Item Unlock permissions.

If you do not require a feature you can easily delete it.

### Renaming Solution / Projects
To rename the Visual Studio Solution, Helix Module Projects and Project references from 'Helixbase' to a new project name, run [rename.ps1](https://github.com/muso31/Helixbase/blob/master/tools/rename.ps1) -ProjectName [NewProjectName]'. 

## Build

Helix Base uses [helix-publishing-pipeline](https://github.com/richardszalay/helix-publishing-pipeline) and pre-configures a number of features.

* Content files from all modules are included in the publish
* Sitecore assemblies are excluded from publish, reducing the package filesize

Local publishing:

* Fast publish-on-build of the Local publish profile. This only adds a few seconds and won't recycle your app pool unless you change code. It even runs your debug Web.config transform!
* Old assemblies (Helixbase.*.dll) are automatically removed

CI/CD publishing:

* Unicorn files are automatically included into App_Data\unicorn. The only variable that needs to be set is `$(sourceFolder)` in [z.Common.DevSettings.config](https://github.com/muso31/Helixbase/blob/master/src/Project/Common/code/App_Config/Include/Project/z.Common.DevSettings.config#L3)

Azure DevOps:

* If you push this repository to Azure DevOps, then in Build Pipelines choose [New build pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline?view=azure-devops&tabs=tfs-2018-2), it will automatically pick up the included [azure-pipelines.yml](https://github.com/muso31/Helixbase/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml) file and create an example build pipeline that uses the Package publish profile.

AppVeyor:

* An example appveyor.xml is included which builds, tests, and packages the solution.
